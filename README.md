#  Declining Fertility Rate; The Civilization Killer


## Context
Fertility rates are quickly declining around the develop world. Most alarming, fertility rates have decreased to below replacement level of 2.1 children. A number of factors contribute to this decline. The declining fertility rate seen in industrialized, developted nations is of grave concern for long term nation building. Declining fertility rates means that the future workforce will be smaller, and in term, a larger percentage of the income of the working population will be dedicated to maintain infratructure, healthcare, and pension schemes. Thus it is vital for long term survivability of a nation that its population continues to grow or atleast maintain in order to avoid economic and demographic collapse.

## Variables 
- Population Density =
- Infant Mortality =
- GDP per Capita =
- Life Expectancy =
- Female College Rate =


## Methodology
For this project, we decided to look at what studies point to be the biggest factors in determining fertility. We decide to look for datasets around the topics of GDP per capita, higher education, life expectancy, fertility, and population in order to regress a model that can predict fertility rates of countries and look for the factors that weigh the most. Because of cultural diversity, we wanted to look at a large range of countries. We decided to use the G20 countries as our baseline do the the ease of getting data and so that we will have a large enough dataset to regress. We are also looking for datasets that go as far back as the 50's. These datasets allowed us to reach the following results.

Description of the Graph:

1. Fertility vs Infant Mortality:

As countries get wealther they get better health care and lower Infant mortality rates and women reponde by having less kids up and past the erplacement rate of 2.1 childern per women.

2. Fertility vs GDP per Capita:

As countrues become wealther at a person basis women have less kids as oppurity cost increase and cost of living increases.

Description of the Graph:

1. Fertility Rate vs Life Expectancy:

As life expectancy increases fertility rate decrease to even below replacement level.

3. GDP per Capita vs Infant Mortality:

As country become wealthier infant mortality dcreases therefore women need to have less kids to have the same number to live to adult hood.

Description of the Graph:

1. Fertility Rate vs Female College Rate:

As women become goto college at higher rates they put off the age they have kids and how many kids they have.

2. Fertility Rate vs Population Density:

As women move to cities they respond by have less kids as it becomes expensive and you have less available space.

The map shows that all the G20 countries are effected by these varibles but just at different times and differnt rates. All countries fertility rate approaches below replacement level.
